#Details

Programs in Dirty Screenshot: `vim`, `screenfetch`, `htop`, `color scripts` (I can't remember the source, maybe someone else can dig it up on request)

 * Notification Daemon: [Dunst](https://github.com/knopwob/dunst)

 * Lock Screen: Generated by [i3lock-fancy](https://github.com/meskarune/i3lock-fancy) which uses [`i3lock-color-git`]( https://github.com/eBrnd/i3lock-color). However, to save time and make it seem more responsive, I just have one image pre-generated based on the wallpaper instead of taking a screenshot each time.
